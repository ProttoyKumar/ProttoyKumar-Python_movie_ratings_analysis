# Python_movie_ratings_analysis
This is a very interesting analysis. Here, I tried to show that 'Fandango' ratings are not trustable. Movie ratings that are shown in 'Fandango' website are not correct. Fandango tends to overrate their movies because they also sells movie tickets. So, they may show higher ratings than actual to make people interested in buying movie tickets. Here, I tried to show the discrepancy that 'Fandango' makes by comparing movie ratings  made by other sites like 'IMDB', Rotten Tomatoes', 'Metacritic' with 'Fandango'. In this project discrepancies made by 'Fandango' are shown by plotting ratings data. This project is a part of https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/.
